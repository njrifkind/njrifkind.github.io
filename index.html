		<h1>Archaeologist turned startup-er</h1>

			<p>Marketing was not something I ever gave much thought to, aside from being mildly annoyed at not being to fast forward through commercials watching The Daily Show on On Demand. I was an archaeologist. "Do what you love," right? Well, that was never much of an issue...until 2011.</p> 
			<p>The more uncertain the world became, the more uncertain I was of my place in it. When it became clear that I would never return to my project site in Syria, and therefore never be able to finish my PhD, it was a shock to the system. I tried to approach this new problem rationally, assessing the data I had on hand, talking my options over with advisors and peers. In the end, however, to continue in archaeology would mean a significant reset, at best a three-year setback and most likely more.</p> 
			<p>Those three years said nothing, too, about the changed landscape I'd be navigating once I had finished. Long gone are the days of well-funded post-docs, tenure track positions and eager research partners. Clearly, to how I defined success would need to change.</p>
			<p>Pragmatism can be a real asset in anyone's personality, in the proper measure. My immediate need was just to find a way to make ends meet. I tried my hand at a lot of things in that first year of my transition; at some point in the dead of winter, I deccided to take a job selling Verizon FiOS door-to-door in the suburbs north of Boston. Rock-bottom is a term that shouldn't be thrown around lightly, but it's apt here. One snowy Tuesday, as I walked around doing the math on what I was making per hour to wander up and down the streets of Woburn, knocking on doors and bothering people warm and cozy in their homes with unasked for opportunities, and wondering why I was seemingly making a conscious effort to avoid my skills, I decided if I couldn't find a job I liked, I'd make one.</p>
			<p>What direction to go in? What skills did I have, hard, soft or otherwise, that would allow me to succeed either on my own or as a valuable part of a small and agile team? My people and project management <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/noam-rifkind/63/168/925">skills</a> are core competencies. I had moved up through the ranks as an archaeologist at the <a href="http://www.jezireh.org/sweyhat_home.html">Tell es-Sweyhat Archaeological Project</a>, in the end reporting directly to the project director, liaising and supporting a host of international specialists and tasked with preparing major research projects and publications for submission. Much of my research had also utilized my analytical skills and a comfort with numbers born of a childhood spent reading <em>The Baseball Encyclopedia</em> as if it were a cherished copy of <em>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</em>.</p>
			<p>I can get a bit long-winded (hard to believe, I know), but I also had plenty of experience from my time as an archaeologist in editing manuscripts. I have a BA in English, with a focus in creative writing, and had just spent the last decade plus immersed in academic literature of all stripes. I decided to try my hand at being a freelance editor and it wasn't long before I'd caught a stroke of tensive have a long background I have long held a deep interest in and passion for urban planning and development. I'm a product of the city, and have been fortunate enough to have spent extended periods of time across the globe, and have never felt more certain that I was in a special place than in my time at the Startup Institute Boston Summer 2014 session.</p>
			<p>I'm excited to again be able to indulge a passion, and to pursue a noble and worthwhile goal. Land and real estate development are not things usually associated with such words but the need for a new approach in those markets is so great as to be, to me, self-evident.</p>
