		<h1>Hello World</h1>
		<a href="http://students.startupinstitute.com/2014/boston/summer/marketing/628/njrifkind/"><img src="https://production-startupschool.s3.amazonaws.com/sipeople-studentprofile/studentprofile-628headshot.JPG" width="20%" height="20"/></a>
			<p>My people and project management <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/noam-rifkind/63/168/925">skills</a> are core competencies. I moved up through the ranks as an archaeologist, in the end reporting directly to project directors and with responsibility for preparing major research projects and publications for submission.</p>
			<p>I have long held a deep interest in and passion for urban planning and development. I'm a product of the city, and have been fortunate enough to have spent extended periods of time across the globe, and have never felt more certain that I was in a special place than in my time at the Startup Institute Boston Summer 2014 session.</p>
			<p>I'm excited to again be able to indulge a passion, and to pursue a noble and worthwhile goal. Land and real estate development are not things usually associated with such words but the need for a new approach in those markets is so great as to be, to me, self-evident.</p>
